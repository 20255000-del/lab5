    Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's term (2016–2022) is over, but not the ‘War on Drugs’ (WOD) associated with his administration. The police-led WOD campaign killed thousands during his regime, estimated between 5500 and 27,000

    and detained nearly 300,000

    unleashing an unprecedented level of violence that attracted international attention. Launched ostensibly as a blanket campaign against illegal drugs in the Philippines, the WOD especially targeted methamphetamine users

    In a large cluster of the WOD literature, the main scholarly concern was how to ‘make sense’ of the WOD. Supporters of the WOD often claim that the popularity of the WOD, attested to by opinion surveys, means the WOD simply makes sense to Filipinos; those who fail to understand it are therefore ‘out of touch’ with the Filipino people

    however found that Duterte, and conversely, the WOD, may not be as popular as the polls depict. Duterte's popularity in polls has been inflated by social desirability bias, a form of preference falsification to appear socially acceptable possibly to protect themselves from being targeted or keep access to

    A prominent feature of the literature on the WOD is the reference to populism, and in particular
     
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/als.2018.12">Penal</a><br>and chauvinist populism.The penal populism thesis explains the popularity of the WOD in terms of politicians and rulers pursuing what they anticipate as a popular policy, regardless of its effectiveness (Johnson & Fernquest, 2018). The premise is that a tough position against criminal and anti-social activity reflected in policies that implement harsh punishment is popular, at least in certain societies (Johnson & Fernquest, 2018; in Kenny & Holmes, 2022). Penal populism is characteristic of corrupt governance that rejects liberal democracy (Iglesias, 2020; Pernia, 2019; Thompson, 2016; Untalan, 2016) in favour of brute force (M. Thompson, 2022a) and efficient justice (Gaspar, 2016).
    . The securitization of drugs (Aculana et al., 2019; Apriellio, 2021; Utama, 2021) and the performance of crises (Lasco, 2020) through the manipulation of the media (Parmanand, 2023), coupled with
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12669">Attacks</a><br>on institutions and mechanisms of accountability (Brooke et al., 2023), allow proponents of the WOD to justify punitive though ineffective policies and isolate critical voices (Iglesias, 2022; Johnson & Fernquest, 2018).3
